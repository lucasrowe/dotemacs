This is my configuration for GNU Emacs.

I have not attempted to use it with XEmacs; it likely will fail there.

How To Use
==========

1. Check out the newest version into $HOME/.emacs.d

   cd $HOME
   git clone git@github.com:kkreamer/dotemacs.git .emacs.d

2. Link $HOME/.emacs to $HOME/.emacs.d/config

   ln -s $HOME/.emacs.d/config $HOME/.emacs

3. Fire up emacs

   $ emacs &

4. For flymake to be able to do python syntax-checking: 
   
   pip install pylint
